# Beer Guide v2
A lil info viz widget about beer, inspired by Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music (the old flash version) a poster I saw at a friend's house once. v1 was done in 2014-15.

## TODO:
* Refresh data (this stuff is from 2015! We hadn't even invented hazy IPAs yet! better times tbh)
* Styling (SRM colors on nodes is cool but not super legible)
* Something about Draggable (either fix the warning or switch to something else)
* Originally this was supposed to show clicked beers on a scatterplot of IBU and ABV to kind of give folks an idea of what range they like but I think that might actually be kind of dumb? But this definitely needs... something else to make it more interesting.
